The goal of the Gene Survey project is to take TCGA Standardized Data and make gene level cross-disease and sometimes cross platform comparisons and evaluations simpler to perform, as these represent common questions asked of PIs and analysts. That is, a common question is: how does gene XYZ act across disease types?

This is one of the two Java applications used for this project. If you are developer or researcher recompiling or modifying this software, start with this project. TcgaGSData depends on this project.

The TcgaIdConverter application performs two actions. First, the TcgaIdConverter application downloads files with various kinds of identifiers from sources on the Internet. Second, TcgaIdConverter provides a Java API to access that data.

TcgaIdConverter is a Netbeans project.
